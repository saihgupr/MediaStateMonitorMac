Get real-time information about what music, video, or other media is currently playing across all applications, and automatically sync this data to Home Assistant as a binary sensor for seamless smart home automation.

## What It Does

MediaStateMonitor sits in your macOS status bar and continuously monitors media playback across your system. It can detect and display information about:

- **Currently playing music** (Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, etc.)
- **Video playback** (YouTube, Netflix, VLC, QuickTime, etc.)
- **Podcast apps** (Overcast, Pocket Casts, etc.)
- **Any media application** that uses system media controls

The app uses AppleScript integration to query the current media state and displays the information in a clean, minimal status bar interface.
